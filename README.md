 # 📝 **Urdu Tweets Sentiment Analysis**  
### 🚀 Developed as part of the **CS-4063 Natural Language Processing** Course

### 📚 **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on building an **Automatic Sentiment Analysis Tool** for **Urdu social media text** from platforms like **Twitter** and **YouTube**. The tool classifies posts into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiments, overcoming the challenges of **Urdu text processing** such as:

- **Urdu Grammar & Morphology** (gender, plurality variations)
- **Handling Noisy Data** (emojis, hashtags, URLs)
- **Short, Incomplete Sentences** commonly found in social media posts

---

## 🛠️ **Key Features**
- **Custom Urdu Stopword Removal**
- **Stemming & Lemmatization** for Urdu morphology
- **Tokenization** for the Urdu script
- **Feature Extraction** using **TF-IDF** and **Word2Vec**
- **Sentiment Classification** using **Logistic Regression**

---

## 🔧 **Tools & Technologies**
- **Python** 🐍
- **NLTK**, **spaCy**, **Polyglot**
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models
- **Gensim** for Word2Vec
- **Pandas**, **Matplotlib** for data analysis & visualization

---

## 📊 **Dataset**
- **Urdu Social Media Dataset**  
Publicly available Urdu sentiment dataset from platforms like **Twitter** and **YouTube**. Contains raw social media posts with corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral).

---

## 📂 **Repository Structure**
- `data/` : Contains the dataset used for the analysis  
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks with the code for preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training  
- `src/` : Python scripts for various NLP tasks  
- `results/` : Contains model performance metrics and visualizations
